#Write code using find() and string slicing (see section 6.10) to extract the number at the end of the line below. 
#Convert the extracted value to a floating point number and print it out.

#Please use the line below:
text = "X-DSPAM-Confidence:    0.8475";
text_num = text.find('0')
new_num = [text_num:]
continue
print new_num
	#how can I assign this to the variable new_num?
	#new_num = float(new_num)
	#print new_num
